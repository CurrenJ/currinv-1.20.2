Welcome to Curren's notes, strange traveller! It's 2023, 11:51 PM in Peckham, London, and I am eating a bowl of moussaka while I type this.

Notes:
- Client only mod means we can only really use classes that are client only, as marked by the @Environment annotation.
- For example, mixins that we add to LootableContainerBlockEntity will not be run when connected to a server, because the block entity logic lives on the server.
- Also, our mod's classes should be marked client only as well. Don't forget!
- Remember to drink water! I am going to do that now. And sleep, bro. The code ain't going anywhere.

- HandledScreen has mouse click logic for chests, which slot is clicked, etc.
- Makes calls to MinecraftClient.ClientPlayerInteractionManager <-- I've a feeling this is our white whale.

Relevant Classes:
- GenericContainerScreen

In addition to capturing the target method arguments, it may be desirable to capture locally-scoped variables from the target method at the point of injection. This is usually executed in two stages:
Set the locals() value of your injection to LocalCapture.PRINT and run the application.
When the injector is processed, a listing of the LVT is produced accompanied by a generated signature for your handler method including the discovered args. Modify your handler signature accordingly.


BlockPos{x=213, y=68, z=54} | BlockPos{x=212, y=68, z=54}
